# CS - SQL Database Course
This is a project I completed for a CS Database course.

Per a given scenario, I used SQL to create a database for a library. I populated the database with information given to me via the class' assignment prompt.

I wrote 14 queries to retrieve various contents of the database. Each query is followed by the result of that query. The file can be navigated through with the table of contents listed at the top of the file.
